# Chores

This a repo containing a client and server to keep track of chores done.
This was created for me to try out GraphQL and front end development.

Hopefully someday I'll understand how to make things look nice...

TODO:
client:
 * displays:
  * allow user to enter their own chores
  * show list of users chores (&points per chore?)
 * data vis:
  * contributions a la github
  * graphs of contributions over time
   * points per day
   * when certain chores are done

server:
 * connect db
