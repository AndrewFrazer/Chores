# Chores

This a repo containing a client and server to keep track of chores done.
This was created for me to try out GraphQL and front end development.

TODO:
client:
 * calendar:
  * show years present in data
 * sections for buttons and data vis?
 * displays:
  * allow user to enter their own chores
  * show list of users chores (&points per chore?)
 * data vis:
  * graphs of contributions over time
   * points per day
   * when certain chores are done

server:
 * might be more efficient to convert to time to date when sent to the 
   server rather than converting each to a date 
  * solves certain problems as is though.
 * connect db
